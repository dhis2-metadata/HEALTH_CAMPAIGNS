# Introduction

Digital tools and platforms like DHIS2 have enormous potential for streamlining health campaign data collection and
real-time monitoring, as well as supporting functions during the pre-campaign planning phase, post-campaign evaluation
and ongoing programmatic analysis and use. Effective use of digital tools for health campaigns can support planners to
optimize resource allocation, monitor performance targets in real-time and assess coverage and health impact alongside
other data sources. Health campaign activities range from supplemental immunization activities (SIA),
insecticide-treated net (ITN) distribution, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and other types of mass drug
administration (MDA), indoor residual spraying (IRS), nutritional supplements and more.

The WHO promotes a number of benefits that can be achieved through an integrated approach to campaign digitalization,
documented in the [Integrated Campaign Digitization Toolkit (2025)](https://iris.who.int/handle/10665/380775). The DHIS2
platform aims to support the integrated principles for digitalization of health campaigns across interventions and
health programs, borrowing lessons learned from 30 years of designing integrated *routine* health information systems.
This document aims to provide practical guidance to national health programmes, campaign planners, DHIS2 implementers
and MOH health information systems units.
